# credit-risk-classification
*Overall the model is pretty solid. In class 0 precision, recall, and f1-score were 100%.  This however can be misleading. With class 1 the model kept an precision score of 87% and recall of 95%, meaning it missed only 5% of the bad loans. The f1-score kept a good balance between precision and recall. Overall I would recommend this model to a banking institution, unless they are trying to minimize losses. A 5% chance of missed high risk loans in a big corporation can equate to hundreds of loans being approved and losses can accumulated. For a bigger institution that risk may be too great the same goes for the precision mislabeling good loans as high risk can excluded new potential customers decreasing profits as well as a loss of customer satisfaction.
